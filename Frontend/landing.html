    <h1> IMPACT </h1>
    <p>Welcome to IMPACT, an interactive installation created by Kate Ladenheim & Ankur Mehta.</p>
    <p>There are two ways to participate: as a faller or as a watcher. </p>
    <p>If you choose to be a faller, proceed to the blue mat and fall on it. You can fall forwards, backwards, or sideways, with whatever force or quality you feel comfortable with. You won't need your phone as a faller.</p>
    <p>If you choose to be a watcher, click the button below. You'll be prompted to choose from four qualities that best describe the faller's action. Make your choice and wait for the robots to respond.</p>
